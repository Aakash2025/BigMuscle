      <p class="sectionTag text-big">An introduction to Bodybuilding</p>
      <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">There is often a negative stigma surrounding body building, and those who dedicate their lives to improving their fitness through perceived extreme exercise. However, this is not necessarily the case. Bodybuilding is a great way to keep yourself balanced, giving your body proportion, shaping and helping general fitness. Not only does body building improve your physical condition, it can also lead to mental health benefits, giving you a clearer state of mind thanks to weight training and aerobic exercise. Having a well-balanced, proportioned body can contribute to heightened health, lessening the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure and raised cholesterol levels. Bodybuilding captures all your fitness goals by giving you the physical improvements, boosting your state of mind and also ensuring you remain on the ball with your diet to supplement all your hard work in the gym.

      <p class="sectionTag text-big">Why diet is important?</p>
      <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">Bodybuilding cannot be achieved through any one aspect alone. The right amount and selection of training, diet and supplementation, recovery, mindset, and genetics, will determine your ability to achieve a desired physique. It is important to understand that the foods you eat are what will be supplying you with the energy to go hard at the gym and the right foods will help increase your muscle building potential.
         <br>
        For muscle to perform at its best, the right amount and types of nutrients must be consumed at the appropriate times. The right balance of macronutrients, (protein, carbohydrates and fats), and micronutrients, (vitamins, minerals and trace elements) is essential. As a quick summary though, it is important to make use of the training window, a period of time where consumption of certain foods and supplements can prove to help with extra gains in muscular size, strength and power. For example a delay of supplementation of more than two hours can significantly reduce protein synthesis and muscle glycogen replenishment.

      <p class="sectionTag text-big">Benifits of workout</p>
      <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">First and foremost, the main benefit of bodybuilding is to enhance your physical condition through exceptional fitness and dedication. This has a healthy impact on your bones and joints, giving you the necessary balance across your body in order to remain strong and flexible. As you begin to embark on your bodybuilding journey, you will notice a dramatic increase in muscle, strength and endurance â€“ but this is a slow process and you will have to remain patient. Results simply do not happen overnight and training all areas of your body is essential to maintaining a balanced physique.
